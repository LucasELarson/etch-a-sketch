create general shape of screen in html and css

have a button that allows the change of the size of the grid LxW with a slider. 
    if you choose 5x5 it will run a for loop to create a 5 squares per each of 5 columns

set up hover function so that if you hover over a square it changes color permanantly
    on hover set background to COLOR and change ID from Unmarked to Marked so it cant be changed again unless the screen is reset

set up additional option that allows for the choice of color change and also a random color per square function.
    if color is selected set another id to that color and change the box to that id
